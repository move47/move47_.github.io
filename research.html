                           <b>Abstract:</b> <p style="text-align: justify;font-size:85%;"> In the modern digital world, a user of a smart system remains surrounded with as well as observed by a number of tiny IoT devices round the clock almost everywhere. Unfortunately, the ability of these devices to sense and share various physical parameters, although play a key role in these smart systems but also causes the threat of breach of the privacy of the users. Existing solutions for privacy-preserving computation for decentralized systems either use too complex cryptographic techniques or exploit an extremely high degree of message passing and hence, are not suitable for the resource-constrained IoT devices that constitute a significant fraction of a smart system. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight strategy LiPI for Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation in low-power IoT systems. The design of the strategy is based on decentralized and collaborative data obfuscation and does not exploit any dependency on any trusted third party. In addition, besides minimizing the communication requirements, we make appropriate use of the recent advances in Synchronous-Transmission (ST)-based protocols in our design to accomplish the goal efficiently. Extensive evaluation based on comprehensive experiments in both simulation platforms and publicly available WSN/IoT testbeds demonstrates that our strategy works up to at least 51.7% faster and consumes 50.5% lesser energy compared to the existing state-of-the-art strategies.</p>

                           <b>Abstract:</b> <p style="text-align: justify;font-size:85%;"> IoT/WSN assisted smart-systems are making our living easier and more comfortable in various aspects. However, there is always a chance of malfunctioning in such massive decentralized systems in crucial moments because of one or more components of the system getting compromised. For instance, monitoring systems installed to watch the status of a bridge may unknowingly suppress the recent deterioration in the status because of some compromised sensing devices. Byzantine fault tolerance support is highly essential in combating the presence of such smart devices with malicious intentions. However, existing solutions for consensus or data aggregation in IoT/WSN systems either assume non-Byzantine node failures or use only simulation/theoretical models to address the existence of Byzantine nodes. Theoretically, a decentralized system can effectively tolerate Byzantine characteristics of up to a certain fraction of the nodes. However, to achieve even that, the nodes need to interact extensively and share data with each other which makes it challenging for such solutions to get practically realized and produce outcomes in real-time, especially in resource-constrained IoT systems. In this work, we adopt Synchronous-Transmission based mechanisms and propose a framework ReLI to efficiently achieve Byzantine consensus in low-power IoT systems. We show that ReLI can operate up to 80% faster and consume up to 78% lesser radio-on time compared to the traditional implementation of the strategy in a publicly available IoT/WSN testbed containing 45 nodes.</p>

                           <b>Abstract:</b> <p style="text-align: justify;font-size:85%;">Preservation of privacy has been a serious concern with the increasing use of IoT-assisted smart systems and their ubiquitous smart sensors. To solve the issue, the smart systems are being trained to depend more on aggregated data instead of directly using raw data. However, most of the existing strategies for privacy-preserving data aggregation, either depend on computation-intensive Homomorphic Encryption based operations or communication-intensive collaborative mechanisms. Unfortunately, none of the approaches are directly suitable for a resource-constrained IoT system. In this work, we leverage the concurrent-transmission-based communication technology to efficiently realize a Multi-Party Computation (MPC) based strategy, the well-known Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS), and optimize the same to make it suitable for real-world IoT systems.</p>
