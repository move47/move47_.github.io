I"<<p>It’s summertime and I think I am back to writing blogs after a long drought. In my blogpost about <a href="/2016/12/31/wncc-wiki-launched.html">Grundy</a> I mentioned work on four projects, the first two being <a href="/2016/12/22/zero-to-established.html">StackOverflow Contribution</a> and <a href="/2016/12/31/wncc-wiki-launched.html">Grundy</a>. My third project was a <em>fitness</em> project, a personal challenge which I started in the end of September, 2016.</p>

<p>On 7th of January, 2017, I successfully cycled 1000 tracked kilometres in 90 days, completing 4 months of an epic project.</p>

<h2 id="cycling">Cycling</h2>

<p>Cycling has always been a fun way to get around. It’s not very exhausting, quick and an excellent way of getting to know what’s going on in a campus. It’s also a good time to introspect and think about challenging techinical problems (only in traffic-free regions!). Last summer I’d purchased a <a href="https://www.snapdeal.com/product/btwin-my-bike/639052040129">BTWIN MyBike</a>. Midnight campus cycling turned out to be my favourite way of getting around the scorching summer heat. I started tracking my rides using a GPS app <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a>.</p>

<p>On an erratic schedule, I was soon trying to beat my own best average speeds, duration and distance. All this came to a sudden stop due to a small accident and the annual monsoon season.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>

<p>Midway through my fifth semester when the clouds were finally clearing up, I restarted my cycling trips - mostly leisure evening rides on the banks of the serene Powai Lake with the backdrop of the setting sun. I finally made up my mind to make this a <em>fitness routine</em>, something I’d never done before.</p>

<p>So it started - a long journey of riding 1000 <em>tracked</em> kilometres in a span of 100 days. This would not include any untracked cycle rides, such as the daily commute to the academic area. I didn’t want to be too rigid in my first fitness routine, so 10 KM / day sounded fairly reasonable. Due to an erratic academic schedule, I decided not to be stringent about completing exactly 10 KM everyday, but rather focus on completing the lump sum over 100 days. I decided to ignore all days where I would be off-campus for more than 24 hours at a stretch or extremely sick.</p>

<h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>

<p>The ever-demanding IIT schedule has a lot of exams, and I knew it would be difficult to exercise a day before exams. So I decided to stay ahead of the schedule. By completing 13-14 KM / day, I would gain a free day every 3 days. I stuck to cycling in the IIT campus, simply because a no-traffic region is safer and a lot quicker.</p>

<p>Three simple things really made all the difference (when I compare this routine with all my previous failed attempts) -</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tracking</strong> - I continued using <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a>, since it provided a very accurate measure of distance travelled. I would analyse the speed and elevation graphs figuring out the best ways to complete kilometres quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://move47.github.io/assets/runkeeper.png" alt="runkeeper" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Daily Planning</strong> - Before every session, I would approximately decide the number of kilometres I intend to ride. This would primarily depend on my overall fatigue level and academic schedule for the day. With Runkeeper’s ride map, I’d soon figured out the paths in IIT I should take to exactly complete those many kilometres. Quite surprisingly, on more than 90% of the trips, I stuck to my plan.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Whiteboard</strong> - Using a whiteboard is what really kept me motivated to keep going. I maintained a very simple statistic, <em>Kilometres Left</em> vs <em>Days Left</em>. I would update this everyday, after every ride. My curious wingmates soon discovered what this statistic meant, and I soon had an additional pressure (drive, rather) to show them a good statistic every day.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hurdles">Hurdles</h2>

<p>With a good plan and achievable target, I did not expect the routine to be super hard. However, some un-expected hurdles popped up throughout the journey.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Street Dogs</strong> - <em>The nights are dark and full of terrors</em>. These mad dogs are going to chase you to death. I had to really restrict the routes of my midnight rides to avoid street dogs. Luckily, I got pretty familiar with their activity and behaviour after 20 days and I kept caution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rain</strong> - A thunderstorm can really ruin your plans. On atleast a couple of occasions, a thunderstorm ruined a 20KM plan, requiring a lot of covering up in the next few days.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Home Trips &amp; Illness</strong> - While I did not count these days, trips to Pune would ruin the momentum, since I rarely exercised while at home. I generally ended up wasting a day or two with 5KM rides to get back on track. I also fell quite ill once in the end of October, another roadblock in the routine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Doing it <em>Daily</em></strong> - Yeah, it’s harder than it seemed. While a day or two is easy, it gets really tiring without a day’s break. The harder part - winning the mental dilemma of staying in a cozy bed vs sweating it out, daily.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-journey">The Journey</h2>

<p>While staying on track was hard at first, I soon became accustomed to a daily cycle ride. It was a time of the day I would look forward to, a break from the stressful academic life. By day#30 I was so used to it that I even cycled the day before each of my end-semesters, light 5-7KM leisure rides, and it helped my exam preparation!</p>

<p>I was three days ahead of my schedule until my winter vacations started. Relieved from my academic load, I covered a lot of KM in the holidays. By the day before my finale, I had 24KM left to cover in 11 days.</p>

<p>On the final day, I broke my distance record for the routines, covering all 24KM in a single session. As a celebration I bought a Cadbury Silk Oreo, and ate the whole bar at once. It was a job well done, and an awesome culmination to a 90 day journey.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>Well, I’ve never really gotten back to a <em>fitness</em> routine after this. I’ve tried walking / running and restarting cycling, but it’s been as erratic as ever. Unfortunately, my sixth semester was too hectic.</p>

<p>I’m hoping to relive these golden days sometime soon in the future (perhaps this summer). While starting something like this takes a lot of mental determination, I atleast now know that I’ve done it once before, and it won’t be too hard to do again!</p>
