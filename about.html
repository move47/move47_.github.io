                    Hi, I’m Himanshu Goyal. I am pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science program at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am specializing in Computing Systems.
                    I recently graduated from the <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar</a> after completing Dual Degree(B.Tech+M.Tech)  
                    in Computer Science and Engineering. 
                    I work closely with <a href="https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile-print.php?furl=sudipta">Prof. Sudipta Saha</a> on practical and
                    scalability aspects of having Byzantine consensus in low-power wireless systems. 
                    In addition to it, I am also working on security &amp; privacy aspects for large scale decentralised systems.
                    Here, I am mainly focussing on developing privacy-preserving solutions for efficient distributive computation over IoT data.
                    I am also closely associated with <a href="https://sites.google.com/iitbbs.ac.in/dssrg">Decentralized and Smart Systems Research Group (DSSRG)</a>
                    at IIT Bhubaneswar.

                    I’ve spent some wonderful summers in both industry and academia via internships. 
                        In Summer 2020, I interned with Embedded Systems and Robotics group team at TCS Research &amp; 
                        Innovation with <a href="http://www.chayansarkar.com/">Chayan Sarkar</a> on building customized language models
                         for cognitive robotics applications. 
                          I also had a short stint working with <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arpita/">Arpita Patra</a> at 
                          <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~cris/about.html">Cryptography and Information Security lab</a>, IISc Bangalore, in 2020.
                           In the Summer of 2019, I worked on workload characterization in Multi-tier Cloud Infrastructure 
                           at <a href="https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/">CNeRG - Complex Networks Research Lab</a>, IIT Kharagpur under the mentorship 
                           of <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/">Sandip Chakraborty</a>.

                    When I’m not working, I am generally lurking on reddit and twitter to keep myself updated about the recent trends in my research work. I would highly recommend following known researchers in your field to get fast access to the latest research directions/developments. I like to collect resources for the benefit of fledgling students under 
                    the <a href="./crypto.html">Crypto Resources</a> and <a href="./misc.html">Miscellaneous</a> sections. The resources may range from basic to advanced level. 
                    I also maintain a <a href="./blog.html">blog</a> that sporadically gets updated.

                    During my undergraduate days, I was associated with <a href="http://www.e-summit-iitbbs.com/">E-Summit</a>, where I both 
                        participated in and organized several events related to Entrepreneurship. 
                        I was also a member of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Fourth-WallDramatics-Society-of-IIT-Bhubaneswar-131402333580109">
                            The Fourth Wall</a>(Dramatics Society of IIT Bhubaneswar), 
                            where I participated in several open and stage acts. I thoroughly enjoyed being here; I am and will cherish it throughout my life.
